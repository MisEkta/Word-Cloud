# Word-Cloud
A small Machine Learning practice project to develop a word cloud using Google Collaboratory. 

A word cloud is a form of visual representation. It is a grouping of words that are displayed in various sizes: the larger and bolder the term, the more frequently it appears in a document and the more important it is. 

Text clouds include data visualization, text data, font colours, word frequency analysis, and specific word graphics. These are ideal techniques to extract the most relevant sections of textual material, from blog posts to databases, and are also known as tag clouds or text clouds. They can also assist business users in comparing and contrasting two separate pieces of text in order to identify phrasing similarities. 

Word clouds are popping up everywhere at the moment. It's no surprise as they are an intuitive way of quickly grasping the major themes of a body of text. They have real application in the business world, and are widely used as a tool in business intelligence and market research.

Trends:
A Google trend analysis confirms the popularity of Word Clouds is sky high. They are no longer confined to the domain of personal blogs as tag clouds, but have found real use in the business wold. This is unsurprising due to the rapid growth of the data analytics industry, and the fact that they can deliver meaningful insight when correctly used. 

Typical used cases:
Words clouds are a popular way to visualise the themes around political speeches, company keynote addresses, company results presentations and IPO filings.

There usefulness don't stop there and some other common applications include:

1. Brand analysis to assess brand perception.
2. Content optimization through keyword identification as part of an SEO strategy.
3. Initial data exploration of large datasets to identify overarching themes.
4. Market research through the visualisation of customer feedback, survey responses and product reviews.

They can of course be applied anytime a large body of text has been generated or collated.
